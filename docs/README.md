Thanks for using Mirai, a (beautiful and intelligent assistant, as well as a) **desktop chatbot application** that helps you track your tasks and makes your life easier!

Mirai is optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI), while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface** (GUI). If you can type fast, Mirai will
get your job done much faster than traditional GUI applications.

# Non-command features
### Saving data
Mirai's data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that alters the data. You do not need to save manually!

### Editing the data file
Task data is saved in a `.txt` file named `mirai.txt`, at `[address of the .jar file]/data/mirai.txt`. Here, tasks are formatted as

| Task type | Syntax | Example |
| --------- | ------ | ------- |
| Todo      | `T \| 0 \| task description` | `T \| 0 \| sleep` |
| Deadline  | `D \| 0 \| task description \| YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm` | `D \| 1 \| submit homework \| 2025-02-20T23:59` |
| Event     | `E \| 0 \| task description \| YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm \| YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm` | `E \| 0 \| meeting \| 2025-02-21T16:00 \| 2025-02-21T18:00` |

Here, content blocks are separated by vertical bars (`|`).
- (**COMMON**) The first content block is the task identifier (`T` for todo, `D` for deadline, and `E` for events)
- (**COMMON**) The second content block is the completion status of the task (`0` for incompleted, `1` for done)
- (**COMMON**) The third content block is the task description. Task descriptions can be more than 1 word, separated with space
- (**Exclusive to DEADLINE and EVENT**) The fourth content block is the date-time.
  - For a deadline task, it is the deadline date-time.
  - For an event task, it is the date-time that the event starts.
- (**Exclusive to EVENT**) The fifth content block is the date-time that an event task ends.

Advanced users are welcome to directly update the data by editing this data file.

# FAQ
**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer.\
**A**: Install `mirai.jar` in the other computer. Overwrite the empty `mirai.jar` data file it creates with the file in your current computer.
